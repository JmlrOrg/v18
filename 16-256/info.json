    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning description logic (DL) ontologies in Angluin et al.'s framework of exact learning via queries. We admit membership queries (\u00e2\u0080\u009cis a given subsumption entailed by the target ontology?\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and equivalence queries (\u00e2\u0080\u009cis a given ontology equivalent to the target ontology?\u00e2\u0080\u009d). We present three main results: (1) ontologies formulated in (two relevant versions of) the description logic DL-Lite can be learned with polynomially many queries of polynomial size; (2) this is not the case for ontologies formulated in the description logic $\\mathcal{E}\\mathcal{L}$, even when only acyclic ontologies are admitted; and (3) ontologies formulated in a fragment of $\\mathcal{E}\\mathcal{L}$ related to the web ontology language OWL 2 RL can be learned in polynomial time. We also show that neither membership nor equivalence queries alone are sufficient in cases (1) and (3).",
