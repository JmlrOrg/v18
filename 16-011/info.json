    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family $\\mathcal{P}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$, and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence by elements in $\\mathcal{P}$. Motivated by this approximation property, the paper addresses the question of estimating an unknown density $p_0$ through an element in $\\mathcal{P}$. Standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or pseudo MLE (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the KL divergence between $p_0$ and $\\mathcal{P}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. We propose an estimator $\\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the <em>Fisher divergence</em>, $J(p_0\\Vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\\in \\mathcal{P}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. When $p_0\\in\\mathcal{P}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\\min\\left\\{\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{2\\beta+1}{2\\beta+2}\\right\\}}$ in Fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\\log p_0\\in\\mathcal{R}(C^\\beta)$ for some $\\beta\\ge 0$, where $C$ is a certain Hilbert-Schmidt operator on $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{R}(C^\\beta)$ denotes the image of $C^\\beta$. We also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\\notin\\mathcal{P}$ and show that $J(p_0\\Vert\\hat{p}_n)\\rightarrow \\inf_{p\\in\\mathcal{P}}J(p_0\\Vert p)$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non- parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage of the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.",
