    "abstract": "Classification is an important supervised learning technique with numerous applications. We develop an angle-based multicategory distance-weighted support vector machine (MDWSVM) classification method that is motivated from the binary distance-weighted support vector machine (DWSVM) classification method. The new method has the merits of both support vector machine (SVM) and distance-weighted discrimination (DWD) but also alleviates both the <em>data piling</em> issue of SVM and the imbalanced data issue of DWD. Theoretical and numerical studies demonstrate the advantages of MDWSVM method over existing angle-based methods.",
