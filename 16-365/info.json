    "abstract": " <code>imbalanced-learn</code> is an open-source python toolbox aiming at providing a wide range of methods to cope with the problem of imbalanced dataset frequently encountered in machine learning and pattern recognition. The implemented state-of-the- art methods can be categorized into 4 groups: (i) under- sampling, (ii) over-sampling, (iii) combination of over- and under-sampling, and (iv) ensemble learning methods. The proposed toolbox depends only on <code>numpy</code>, <code>scipy</code>, and <code>scikit-learn</code> and is distributed under MIT license. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with <code>scikit-learn</code>  and is part of the <code>scikit-learn-contrib</code> supported project. Documentation, unit tests as well as integration tests are provided to ease usage and contribution. Source code, binaries, and documentation can be downloaded from  <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn\">github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn</a>.",
