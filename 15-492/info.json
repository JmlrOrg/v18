    "abstract": "SnapVX is a high-performance solver for convex optimization problems defined on networks. For problems of this form, SnapVX provides a fast and scalable solution with guaranteed global convergence. It combines the capabilities of two open source software packages: Snap.py and CVXPY. Snap.py is a large scale graph processing library, and CVXPY provides a general modeling framework for small-scale subproblems. SnapVX offers a customizable yet easy-to-use Python interface with <q>out-of- the- box</q> functionality. Based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), it is able to efficiently store, analyze, parallelize, and solve large optimization problems from a variety of different applications. Documentation, examples, and more can be found on the SnapVX website at <a href=\"http://s nap.stanford.edu/snapvx\">snap.stanford.edu/snapvx</a>.",
