    "abstract": "We introduce Refinery, an open source platform for exploring large text document collections with topic models. Refinery is a standalone web application driven by a graphical interface, so it is usable by those without machine learning or programming expertise. Users can interactively organize articles by topic and also refine this organization with phrase-level analysis. Under the hood, we train Bayesian nonparametric topic models that can adapt model complexity to the provided data with scalable learning algorithms.  <a href=\"http://daeilkim.github.io/refinery/\">The project website</a>  contains Python code and further documentation.",
