    "abstract": "We aim at recovering the weighted adjacency matrix $\\mathsf{W}$ of an undirected graph from a perturbed version of its eigenspaces. This situation arises for instance when working with stationary signals on graphs or Markov chains observed at random times. Our approach relies on minimizing a cost function based on the Frobenius norm of the commutator $\\mathsf{A} \\mathsf{B}-\\mathsf{B} \\mathsf{A}$ between symmetric matrices $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{B}$. We describe a particular framework in which we have access to an estimation of the eigenspaces and provide support selection procedures from theoretical and practical points of view. In the Erd\u00c5\u0091s-R\u00c3\u00a9nyi model on $N$ vertices with no self-loops, we show that identifiability (i.e., the ability to reconstruct $\\mathsf{W}$ from the knowledge of its eigenspaces) follows a sharp phase transition on the expected number of edges with threshold function $N\\log N/2$. Simulated and real life numerical experiments assert our methodology.",
